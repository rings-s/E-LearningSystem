1. First, think through the problem, read the codebase for the relevant files, and write a plan to [todo.md]. If code uses SvelteKit 2.x (Svelte 5) + TailwindCSS v4 or Django 5.2, keep that in mind but don’t include framework-specific code unless requested or uploaded.

2. The plan should have a list of TODO items that you can check off as you complete them. Only include Svelte or Django-related tasks if those parts are being worked on.

3. Before you begin working, check in with me and I will verify the plan. If I ask for backend (Django) code, focus only on that. If I ask for frontend (SvelteKit), give that part only.

4. Then begin working on the TODO items, marking them as complete as you go. If both frontend and backend files are uploaded, always start by analyzing the backend (Django), then refactor the frontend (Svelte) accordingly.

5. Please, every step of the way, just give me a high-level explanation of what changes you’ve made — no deep dives unless I ask.

6. Make every task and every code change as simple as possible. Everything is about simplicity and clarity — no unnecessary abstraction or complexity.

6.5. When working on frontend, always use top-tier UI/UX and web design practices — layout should be clean and single for the entire app, modern, responsive, and use the most **simple code** possible with TailwindCSS v4 and SvelteKit.

7. Finally, add a review section to the [todo.md] with a summary of the changes you made and any other relevant information. Note if the changes involved SvelteKit 2.x (Svelte 5), Tailwind v4, or Django 5.2, Django-restframework v3.16
