# Todo List

## Fix errors on the learn page

- [x] **Investigate the codebase:** 
  - [x] Locate the relevant `+page.svelte` file for the learn page.
  - [x] Examine `analytics.service.js` to understand the `forEach` error.
  - [x] Check `core.js` API file to find the correct function for tracking activity.
  - [x] Inspect the code related to fetching enrollments to resolve the `.find` is not a function error.

- [x] **Implement fixes:**
  - [x] Fix the `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'forEach')` in `analytics.service.js`.
  - [x] Fix the `TypeError: coreApi.trackActivity is not a function` in `+page.svelte`.
  - [x] Fix the `TypeError: enrollments.find is not a function` in `+page.svelte`.

- [ ] **Review changes:**
  - [ ] Add a review section to this `todo.md` with a summary of the changes made.

## Review

### Changes Made:

1.  **`front/src/lib/services/analytics.service.js`**:
    -   Modified the `countActivitiesByDay` function to safely handle cases where `activities` might be `null` or `undefined` by initializing it as an empty array if it's not provided. This prevents the `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'forEach')`.

2.  **`front/src/lib/apis/core.js`**:
    -   Added a new asynchronous function `trackActivity` to the `coreApi` object. This function sends a POST request to the `/core/activities/` endpoint with the provided `data`, resolving the `TypeError: coreApi.trackActivity is not a function`.

3.  **`front/src/routes/(app)/courses/[uuid]/learn/+page.svelte`**:
    -   Modified the `loadEnrollment` function to ensure that the `enrollments` variable, which is the result of `coursesApi.getMyEnrollments()`, is always an array. This was done by using `(await coursesApi.getMyEnrollments()) || []`, which prevents the `TypeError: enrollments.find is not a function` if `getMyEnrollments()` returns a non-array value (e.g., `null` or `undefined`).

These changes specifically target the errors reported on the learn page (`+page.svelte`) and its related service/API files, without affecting the design or other pages of the application.
